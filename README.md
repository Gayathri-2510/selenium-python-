# selenium-python

This Python script automates the extraction of RFQ (Request for Quotation) data from the Alibaba sourcing website using Selenium WebDriver. It navigates to the specified URL, waits for the page to load, and retrieves relevant RFQ information such as RFQ ID, title, buyer name, inquiry time, quotes left, country, quantity required, email confirmation status, experience level, interactive user status, inquiry URL, and inquiry date. The script also captures buyer images and analyzes specific textual indicators within React components to determine various statuses, including whether the buyer is experienced, if the response includes typical replies, if the user is interactive, and whether the email is confirmed. The extracted data is then saved into a CSV file with a timestamped filename, where the inquiry date is formatted as "day-month-year" for clarity, and all dates are stored in the specified format. This automation facilitates efficient data collection for market analysis or research purposes, with provisions for handling dynamic web content and ensuring data accuracy. The script is designed to be flexible and can be customized further to include additional data points or adapt to webpage structure changes.
